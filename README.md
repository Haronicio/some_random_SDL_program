In high school I leaned heavily on the SDL C library for graphic display, I bulked up all the little programs that I had made

GRAVITY

Several versions of a gravity simulator, the most successful version is v6.5.1 which allows you to create new objects,
the program is full of bugs but you can explore different configuration and performance improvements over the versions.

ROTATION 3D

See my other project Wireframe Constructor

TERRAIN_GEN

A terrain processing simulator
